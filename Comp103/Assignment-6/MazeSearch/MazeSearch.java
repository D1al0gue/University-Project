/**
 * Search for a path to the goal in a maze.
 * The maze consists of a graph of MazeCells:
 *  Each cell has a collection of neighbouring cells.
 *  Each cell can be "visited" and it will remember that it has been visited
 *  A MazeCell is Iterable, so that you can iterate through its neighbour cells with
 *    for(MazeCell neighbour : cell){....
 *
 * The maze has a goal cell (shown in green, two thirds towards the bottom right corner)
 * The maze.getGoal() method returns the goal cell of the maze.
 * The user can click on a cell, and the program will search for a path
 * from that cell to the goal.
 * 
 * Every cell that is looked at during the search is coloured  yellow, and then,
 * if the cell turns out to be on a dead end, it is coloured red.
